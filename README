# Pocketcast Utils

Pocketcast Utils is an UserScript that aims to enhance the default Pocketcast interface and experience. 
It does this by both adding new, and streamlining existing functionality and interfaces.

Of course, this should never result in degrading the overal experience. 
Therefore, you can choose to enable or disable any of it's features as you please.
These changes take effect immediately; you can see their result in the background.
By default, certain options will be enabled/disabled, to showcase the main features without getting in the way and overwhelming you.

The settings screen can be found under the cog in the top right corner (which, incidentally, is the only thing you cannot turn off).
It's the 'Utils Settings' item from the dropdown menu.
